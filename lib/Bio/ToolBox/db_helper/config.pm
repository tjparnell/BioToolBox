=head1 NAME

Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::config

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module accesses the biotoolbox configuration file. This file stores 
multiple database connection settings. It also stores the paths to various 
helper applications. 

The default location for the file is in the user's home directory. 
Alternatively, the location of the file may be referenced through an 
Environment setting under the key C<BIOTOOLBOX>.

Versions prior to 1.54 automatically wrote a config file in every user's 
home directory, whether it was needed or wanted or not. With version 
1.54, a config file is B<only> written when necessary by adding a program 
path or database entry.

The file is intended to be edited by the user for their custom installation. 
The file is a simple INI style text file. The format is detailed below.

=head1 FORMAT

The BioToolBox configuration file F<.biotoolbox.cfg> is a simple INI-style 
text file. Blocks of settings begin with a C<[header]> line, followed by lines 
of key = value. The value may be single text or comma delimited lists. Examples of 
settings include the following.

=over 4

=item default_db

These are default settings that are shared by all databases.

  [default_db]
  user                     = nobody
  pass                     = hello
  adaptor                  = DBI::mysql
  dsn_prefix               = dbi:mysql:

The user and password keys are for authenticating to a relational 
database. B<WARNING!>
For sanity and security sake, please, B<PLEASE>, generate a read-only 
user for relational database access. Do NOT use a privileged account. 
Any password written here is for all to see and is merely a convenience.

The adaptor key specifies the module driver for connecting to the relational 
database containing the L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> database. Acceptable 
values include C<DBI::mysql>, C<DBI::Pg>, or C<DBI::SQLite>. 

The dsn key defines the string for connecting to the database. For example, 
to connect to a mysql database 'genome' on localhost through a socket

	dbi:mysql:genome

to connect to a remote mysql database

	dbi:mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=3306;database=genome

The dsn_prefix key simply drops the database name, allowing it to be used 
with any database name.

See the documentation for L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> for syntax of 
C<adaptor> and C<dsn_prefix> keys. 

Multiple database sections may be included. Simply name the section after the 
name of the database. Database specific keys may be included, and missing 
keys will default to the C<default_db> values. 

=item Applications

Some BioToolBox scripts require helper programs. Enter the name of the 
helper program and the full path of its location. Executable programs 
may also be automatically found in the system path.

  [applications]
  wigToBigWig      = /usr/local/bin/wigToBigWig
  bedToBigBed      = /usr/local/bin/bedToBigBed

=head1 USAGE

The module exports a single L<Config::Simple> object (C<$BTB_CONFIG>) representing 
the biotoolbox settings in the configuration file. Please refer to the 
documentation for L<Config::Simple> for usage.

If an existing configuration file is not present, then it will write a new 
default file in the user's home directory. I make the assumption that the 
user has write privileges in their own home directory. It will fail otherwise.

Two subroutines may be optionally exported for assistance in manipulating the 
configuration file.

=over 4

=item add_database

Easily add a new database configuration block to the file. Pass an array of 
key =E<gt> values to be added as a new configuration block. You must include a 
name =E<gt> short name to label the block. This should be unique in the file, 
if you are adding a new database. Otherwise, it will probably clobber the 
pre-existing configuration block (which may be what you want it to do).
Follow the FORMAT examples for details on what to provide. 

It will attempt to rewrite the configuration file, if the user has write 
privileges. If not, then it will attempt to write a new file in the user's 
home root directory. It will return true upon success. 

   my $success = add_database(
      'name'    => 'hg19',
      'adaptor' => 'DBI::SQLite',
      'dsn'     => '/path/to/hg19.sqlite',
   );

=item add_program

Easily add the path to a binary executable for future reference. This is 
a little bit faster to find in here than searching for it through the 
system PATH.

It will attempt to rewrite the configuration file, if the user has write 
privileges. If not, then it will attempt to write a new file in the user's 
home root directory. It will return true upon success. 

   my $success = add_program('/path/to/wigToBigWig');
